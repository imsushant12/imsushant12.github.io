## Who am I?

I am an enthusiastic and goal-driven Senior Year Student at Lakshmi Narain College of Technology Excellence pursuing my bachelor's in Computer Science and Engineering. Following my passion for technology, I have never kept myself restricted to the assigned course's curriculum; instead, I always look to explore and learn about new technologies around me. I'm currently working as an Intelligent Automation Engineer at **PwC, India**. I have experience in Development and Content Writing.

Being a wordsmith who loves playing with words, I worked for organizations like Scaler and GeeksForGeeks. I documented my projects, learnings, and knowledge on various technical topics like C/C++, Python, Front end development, DBMS, OS, and open-source development to give back to my community and share the knowledge with those who desire to learn. I have brainstormed and delivered more than 250 articles on **Scaler Academy** platform and more than 50 articles on the **GeeksForGeeks** platform. I constantly work on open-source, and I have been a Project Administrator, Mentor, and Participant in various open-source initiatives.

I believe in practicality, so I like to develop and build something whenever I learn any new tech stack. Testing, Experimenting, and Globalizing are three methods via which I test my learning, and open-source contribution allows me to execute all these methods. It allows me to present my expertise in front of developers worldwide and learn from them. As a community-driven individual sharing responsibility to serve and upskill the technical community, I joined the prestigious Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program, reached to Beta level, conducted 10+ events on topics like Azure and its technologies, cloud computing, and mentored 100s of students via other platforms as well like Hack TX.
