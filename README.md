# Hi, I am Sushant👋🏻!

## Who am I?

I am a Senior Analyst at PwC, India, with a strong background in Computer Science and Engineering. As a tech enthusiast, I am passionate about exploring new technologies and leveraging them to drive innovation and efficiency. Being a wordsmith who loves playing with words, I have written more than 500 articles by working for organizations like Scaler, and GeeksForGeeks. I documented my projects, learnings, and knowledge on various technical topics and open-source development to give back to my community and share the knowledge with those who desire to learn.

I believe in practicality, so I like to develop and build something whenever I learn any new tech stack. Testing, Experimenting, and Globalizing are three methods via which I test my learning, and open-source contribution allows me to execute all these methods. It allows me to present my expertise in front of developers worldwide and learn from them. As a community-driven individual sharing responsibility to serve and upskill the technical community, I joined the prestigious Microsoft Learn Student Ambassadors program, reached to Beta level, conducted 10+ events on topics like Azure and its technologies, cloud computing, and mentored 100s of students via other platforms as well like Hack TX.
